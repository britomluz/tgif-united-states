        <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
          government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their
          public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
        <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend
          taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
          governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
          Government is doing.</p>
        <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
          effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public
          officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become
          actively engaged in American government.</p>
        <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public
          feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                  opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on
                  absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                  legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                  then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                  constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more
                  broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

                <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of
                  the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
                  press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to
                  row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
                  writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often
                  linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
                  adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to
                  the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence
                  in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in
                  1999).</p>

                <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information
                  Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
